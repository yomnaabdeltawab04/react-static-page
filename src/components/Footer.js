kindness is one.
         Although she suffers ill treatment from her stepfamily, she remains kind and 
forgiving in her heart and ultimately emerges happy.
         In that, it is underscored that keeping ones integrity and acts of kindness even in 
periods of misfortune shall
         indeed lead to a good reward.</p>
