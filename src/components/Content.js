      <p>The story Cinderella is a classic fairy tale about a meek young woman,
         who, after her mother died, became the servant of her cruel stepmother and 
stepsisters.
         They make her do all the housework and sleep near the fireplace, from which she 
takes the name Cinderella.
         But even in dire circumstances, Cinderella was gentle and kind-hearted.</p>

      <p>One day, the royal family put out word that there would be a grand ball so that the 
prince could seek a bride.
        Cinderellas stepmother and step-sisters went off to the ball, leaving Cinderella 
behind.
        But her fairy godmother appeared and magically gave Cinderella a fine dress, a pair 
of glass slippers,
        and a carriage but warned that the charm would wear off at midnight.
        The prince fell in love with Cinderella and danced alone with her. But as midnight 
approached, she fled,
        leaving one slipper behind.</p>

      <p>The prince goes around looking for the maiden and uses the slipper to find her.
        When he comes to Cinderellas house, her stepsisters attempt unsuccessfully to fit the 
slipper onto their feet.
        Finally, Cinderella is brought in, and you will never guess. It fits her!
        The prince recognizes her as his long-sought lady of the ball and marries beautiful 
Cinderella,
        who forgives her cruel stepmother and stepsisters and after this, they live happily 
together. </p>
